Welcome to the DIALOGUE wiki!

DIALOGUE is a method for mapping multicellular configurations based on single-cell data. By combining penalized matrix decomposition with multilevel modeling, DIALOGUE robustly recovers spatial information, characterizes the cell environment only based on its transcriptome, and identifies generalizable multicellular programs/configurations, including those that underly different phenotypes of interest in health and disease.
